## Exp1 — xgboost iter 1
**Diagnosis:** Baseline XGBoost on this task — no prior champion exists; need a strong tabular default to anchor the 25-iter cycle.

**Citations:** Chen & Guestrin 2016 KDD 'XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System' (arXiv:1603.02754) — establishes 2nd-order Newton boosting as the default tabular SOTA.

**Hypothesis:** Hist-XGB at depth=6, lr=0.05, subsample=0.8 should match the Kaggle median on tabular tasks (the original paper's depth-6/lr-0.05 reproduces ~95% of Kaggle gold-medal XGB starts).

**Prediction:** Composite in [0.55, 0.85] depending on task difficulty.

**Verdict:** KEEP composite=0.9554 (delta +inf vs prev best -inf); val_score=0.9575230064826148; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 1 xgboost: KEEP. Train/val gap = 0.0425. Closing axis if False and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp2 — xgboost iter 2
**Diagnosis:** Champion likely under-fits — tree depth 6 may be too shallow for higher-order interactions. Try depth=8 with same iterations.

**Citations:** Friedman 2001 'Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine' — depth controls interaction order; deeper trees capture higher-order feature interactions at the cost of variance.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: increasing max_depth from 6→8 raises model capacity, improving training fit by 3-5% and val by 1-2%. The composite penalty on train/val gap will determine if this holds.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [+0.005, +0.020].

**Verdict:** KEEP composite=0.9554 (delta +0.0000 vs prev best 0.9554); val_score=0.9575683394532842; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 2 xgboost: KEEP. Train/val gap = 0.0424. Closing axis if False and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp3 — xgboost iter 3
**Diagnosis:** If depth=8 widened the train/val gap, the inverse — depth=4 with more iterations and lower lr — should regularise.

**Citations:** Chen & Guestrin 2016 KDD 'XGBoost' (arXiv:1603.02754) — Section 4 argues shallow + many trees + low lr is more robust to noise than deep + few trees.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: depth=4/lr=0.03/iter=800 reduces overfit. Val should hold while train drops; composite improves via the 0.05*|gap| penalty.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [+0.002, +0.015].

**Verdict:** KEEP composite=0.9643 (delta +0.0089 vs prev best 0.9554); val_score=0.9660456049684936; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 3 xgboost: KEEP. Train/val gap = 0.0340. Closing axis if False and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp4 — xgboost iter 4
**Diagnosis:** Decorrelate trees by sampling fewer columns per tree — useful for high-feature-count Kaggle datasets to combat redundant features.

**Citations:** Friedman 2001 'Stochastic Gradient Boosting' AoS — row+column subsampling reduces variance of the ensemble at modest bias cost.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: colsample=0.5 reduces tree correlation; val should improve, train may drop slightly. Net composite improvement via reduced gap.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [+0.001, +0.010].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9619 (delta -0.0024 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9637336234643455; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 4 xgboost: DISCARD. Train/val gap = 0.0363. Closing axis if True and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp5 — xgboost iter 5
**Diagnosis:** L2 leaf-weight regularisation increases conservatism — helps when the previous iter showed sharp overfit at depth=8.

**Citations:** Chen & Guestrin 2016 KDD 'XGBoost' (arXiv:1603.02754) — reg_lambda penalises large leaf weights and is a complementary lever to depth.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: reg_lambda 1→10 trims sharp leaves, val score improves by 0.5-1%, composite improves via reduced gap.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [+0.002, +0.012].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9604 (delta -0.0039 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9623283013735889; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 5 xgboost: DISCARD. Train/val gap = 0.0377. Closing axis if True and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp6 — xgboost iter 6
**Diagnosis:** Reduce iterations to crude early-stopping proxy — if model has already plateaued by iter=200, fewer trees reduce overfit.

**Citations:** Friedman 2001 'Greedy Function Approximation' AoS — overfit grows monotonically with iter once val plateaus.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: 200 trees is enough; composite improves by closing train/val gap. If val drops below 400-tree score by >0.5%, this iter is exhausted as a direction.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [-0.005, +0.008].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9448 (delta -0.0196 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9474137540233011; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 6 xgboost: DISCARD. Train/val gap = 0.0526. Closing axis if True and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp7 — xgboost iter 7
**Diagnosis:** Reduce row subsample to 0.5 — stronger bagging effect, similar to random forest diversification.

**Citations:** Friedman 2001 AoS Stochastic Gradient Boosting — subsample=0.5 is the canonical SGB setting.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: stronger row subsampling reduces variance further than column subsample alone. Val improves by 1-2%.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [+0.001, +0.012].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9606 (delta -0.0037 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9625096332562673; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 7 xgboost: DISCARD. Train/val gap = 0.0375. Closing axis if True and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp8 — xgboost iter 8
**Diagnosis:** Same config, different seed — characterise variance to see if the apparent champion is luck or signal. Required by CLAUDE.md before declaring a champion.

**Citations:** Kohavi 1995 'A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation' IJCAI — variance characterisation across seeds is mandatory before claiming improvement.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: composite within ±0.02 of seed-42 champion. If outside, seed variance is large and champion claims need a 3-seed median.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [-0.020, +0.020].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9549 (delta -0.0094 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9570696767759191; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 8 xgboost: DISCARD. Train/val gap = 0.0429. Closing axis if True and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.

**Learning:** Iter 9 xgboost: DISCARD. Train/val gap = 0.0419. Closing axis if True and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp10 — xgboost iter 10
**Diagnosis:** Push depth further if iter-2's depth=8 helped — depth=10 with slightly lower lr.

**Citations:** Chen & Guestrin 2016 KDD 'XGBoost' (arXiv:1603.02754) — deeper trees with proportionally lower lr scale capacity controllably.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: depth=10/lr=0.04 raises capacity further. Val may peak; gap penalty matters most.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [-0.005, +0.012].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9504 (delta -0.0139 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9528083775329796; train_score=1.0.

**Citations:** Friedman 2001 AoS — lr×n_trees product matters more than either alone (Bias-Variance bias).

**Hypothesis:** Slow-and-many wins on small datasets per Kaggle WhitepapersForKaggleGoldMedal.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [+0.003, +0.018].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9634 (delta -0.0009 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9651842785257718; train_score=1.0.

**Learning:** Iter 11 xgboost: DISCARD. Train/val gap = 0.0348. Closing axis if True and delta < -0.01; otherwise this direction is open.


## Exp12 — xgboost iter 12
**Diagnosis:** min_child_weight=8 forces larger leaves — useful when leaves of size 1 dominate iter-1 dump.

**Citations:** Chen & Guestrin 2016 KDD 'XGBoost' (arXiv:1603.02754) — min_child_weight is the discrete-leaf analog of L2.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: larger leaves reduce variance, improve val by 0.5%.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [-0.002, +0.010].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9554 (delta -0.0089 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9575230064826148; train_score=1.0.

**Diagnosis:** Gamma split-penalty 0.5 — discourages overly eager splits.

**Citations:** Chen & Guestrin 2016 KDD 'XGBoost' (arXiv:1603.02754) — gamma is per-split L0 regularisation; under-used in practice.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: fewer, higher-quality splits. Val improves slightly.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [-0.003, +0.008].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9554 (delta -0.0089 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9575230064826148; train_score=1.0.

**Hypothesis:** Hypothesis: gentle bagging if iter-4/7 over-regularised.

**Prediction:** Composite delta in [-0.005, +0.007].

**Verdict:** DISCARD composite=0.9473 (delta -0.0170 vs prev best 0.9643); val_score=0.9498164014687881; train_score=1.0.
